# Express Boilerplate 
Hello new padawan's and old Jedi's this is a simple boilerplate for init a project with:
+ Eslint Configurated
+ EditorConfig
+ Basic .gitignore
+ Last feature of babel
+ Some npm tasks
+ .gitattributes for linux support files
# PS
if you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) you can improve your project doing changes in user settings and workspace settings for a better developement experience.
